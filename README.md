# Facebook Data Visualizer

The Facebook Data Visualizer enables the logged-in user to visualize data through the Graph API and the account ID of the Facebook ad manager. The following Facebook data is displayed: Amount Spent, Impressions and Clicks. These key figures are obtained from Facebook and output and graphically displayed on the OnePage application. In addition, the drop-down function offers the option of displaying the data in the desired time span.

## 1. Key figures

### 1.1. Amount Spent

The "Amount spent" in the "Account overview" area of ​​the Ads Manager shows the total amount that has been spent on all campaigns in a period selected by the user. Please note that this is also an estimate, as it can take up to 48 hours for the ad results to be processed (Facebook Business-Hilfebereich, 2020a).

### 1.2. Impressions

Impressions are the number of times an advertising contribution is displayed on the corresponding page (e.g. online shop). For example, if someone saw a page update on their Facebook news feed and then saw the same update when a friend shared it, that would count as 2 impressions. Reach is the number of people who received impressions of a page post (Facebook Business-Hilfebereich, 2020b).

### 1.2. Clicks

Link clicks are the number of clicks on links to selected destinations or experiences on or outside of Facebook properties. (Ex: someone clicks "Shop Now" on your ad and goes to your website). ... clicks on websites and app stores directly from links in the ad in the news feed (Facebook Business-Hilfebereich, 2020c).
